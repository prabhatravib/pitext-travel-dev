Avoid unnecessary mocks

- Do not propose or generate mock tests unless a direct test of the real code is impractical.  
- Favour real unit or integration tests that hit actual implementations.  
- Introduce a mock only when an external dependency blocks testing and mocking is the simplest safe workaround.  
- If the environment, tooling, or schedule cannot support mocks, skip them and document the untested areas instead.
